# GreaseMonkey scripts

Since scripts are stored in an SQLite DB, to import a script either create a new script from within the Firefox UI, or build a zip file and use the GreaseMonkey "import backup" feature.

To generate a zip file that GM can import, download a source zip release from the `Releases` tab.
